This is Countdown.

Countdown was inspired by a particularly hard anagram (well, OK, maybe it wasn't that hard...) on the TV show by the same name.

The program takes two inputs:
1) The anagram to check
2) The wordlist to check against

For example...

Countdown.exe "MAYBEANANAGRAM" ~/mywordlist.txt

The wordlist must be newline delimited.

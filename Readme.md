#Countdown </br>
This Programm is based on the TV-Show COUNTDOWN, in which contestans have to find anagrams </br>
for words.We wanted to simplify it a little bit, and created this program.

#How-to compile

If you're on Linux, go to a Terminal and simply type
```
cd ~/directoryPath/Countdown
g++ main.cpp -o Countdown
```
This should also work on Mac.
</br>
</br>

If you're on windows, you will have to download a c++-Compiler (we recommend Code::Blocks) to  </br>
compile the files

#Use

</br>
To use this programm, you have to first look up a word list (will eventually be uploaded).

then go to the Terminal / CMD and start the Programm with those arguements:
</br>
```
~/directoryPath/Countdown $ ./Countdown anagramWord wordlist.txt
```
</br>
Or a more real process: 
```
~/directoryPath/Countdown $ ./Countdown HELLO myWords.txt
```
